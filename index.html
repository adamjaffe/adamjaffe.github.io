			<p id="desc">Adam Jaffe is a Wharton graduate and investment banker-turned-screenwriter who is now learning to do some technical marketing-y things. He loves to talk about transhumanism, surfing, Raymond Carver, and knows an unfortunate amount of gossip about celebrity children. He has no idea why you're here, or why he's here, or why any of us are here. Maybe try meditating?</p>
